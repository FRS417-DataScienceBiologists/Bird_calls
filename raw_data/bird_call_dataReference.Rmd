## Questions
1. Where is the greatest frequency variation? Mean, SD of frequency data
2. Is there a corrolation between freq range and recording duration?
3. Make a box plot to view category = bird, buzz, other animal + y = frequencies





## Extras
2. Is recording length different for each animal? Can they be grouped for duration?
3. Are there more birds singing together than alone? (key word "another bird")
4. If not a bird, are the animal noises mostly insects?
